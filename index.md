## About Me
I've always had a love for deductive reasoning, something I got to explore in pursuit of my mathematics bachelor, and wanted to employ this style of thinking in my career. 
At the same time, I wanted to do something practical. I wanted to feel like I'm actively participating in making our world a better place in which to live.
I see programming as the holy grail of these two passions. 
It's not an exaggeration to say it's the most potentially consequential field we've ever developed.
